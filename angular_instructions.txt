Complete this before the interview. The purpose of this application is to show how you utilize various features offered by the angular framework such as (components, services, directives, routing, forms, etc..) and apply best practices during development cycle.

Instructions:
Implement a Form with the following Inputs (and Validators):
  E-Mail address (required and should be an email address)
  A Dropdown which allows the user to select from three different Status levels ("Executive Platinum", "Platinum Pro", "Platinum") Set "Platinum Pro" as Default
  A Password field (is required and must be 8 characters long with at least one character and one special character)
  A Submit Button and A Clear Button

Additionally:
Display a warning message if the Form is invalid and was touched but only after user has stopped typing. 
Display a warning message below each input if it's invalid and a cumulative message at the top of the form with all the errors at the top of the form on submit. 
If form is modified and clear is clicked, prompt user confirming that they are sure to discard the changes. 
Upon submitting the form, you should simply print the Value of the Form in a separate page.
